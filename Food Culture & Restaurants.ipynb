    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The perks of being the emperor’s home for almost 400 years continue today in Kyoto’s rich food culture. Here are some highlights of Kyoto’s ever-evolving ancient cuisine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The local food culture is diverse and ranges from aristocratic kaiseki course dinners to vegetarian shojin ryori of monks and the simple obanzai home-style cooking. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pontocho nightlife district is one of the best places to find good fusion restaurants alongside traditional establishments. Not far away, the Gion district also offers a wide range of interesting dining opportunities, as does the Kyoto Station area. Regular Japanese food that is not necessarily associated with Kyoto in particular, such as ramen, sushi and udon, is also available across the city. Food fans should not miss a visit to the Nishiki Market in central Kyoto, which has been serving the city for many centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**As you might know, Kyoto is known for the quality of its water. That’s why Kyoto is famous for Tofu, Sake, and Soba.** All of these require a good quality of water to produce. Kyoto’s cuisine is known for its elegance and refinement both in taste and presentation. Because the city lies in a basin embraced by mountains, it has clean, soft, fresh groundwater that’s ideal for making high-quality tofu products, soba noodles, matcha tea and sake.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now let me talk about Kyoto’s food culture a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyoto is basically surrounded by mountains, and people there did not have access to fresh seafood in the past. That’s the reason why they have developed a lot of cooking techniques to preserve food.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of 5 things you should try when you make a trip to Kyoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Soba & Nishin Soba (Herring Soba):** A type of Japanese noodle made from buckwheat flour, soba is a popular dish in Kyoto and can be served hot or cold with a variety of dipping sauces.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obanzai:** - A type of home-style cooking that uses local Kyoto ingredients, obanzai dishes are often simple  and comforting, and may include items such as pickles, simmered vegetables, and grilled fish. - **a Japanese version of Spanish tapas**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saba Sushi** (σκουμπρί και χέλι)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kyoto Ramen**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kaiseki Ryori** - A traditional Japanese multi-course meal that typically features seasonal ingredients and a range of cooking techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vegetarian shojin ryori**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Yudofu** - A tofu-based dish that is popular in Kyoto, yudofu involves simmering tofu in a hot pot and then dipping it in a variety of sauces.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conger eel** (χέλι)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tsukemono (Japanese pickles)**\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------- **Desserts:** ---------------------------\n",
    "1. **Yatsuhashi**\n",

    "### Soba & Nishin Soba (Herring Soba)\n",
    "\n",
    "Soba is Japanese buckwheat noodles, as I explained in my Tokyo Food Guide. But why eat soba in Kyoto?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might know, Kyoto is known for the quality of its water. That’s why Kyoto is famous for Tofu, Sake, and Soba. All of these require a good quality of water to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, have you tried herring soba called **“Nishin Soba”** in Japanese? Not Nisshin Cup Noodles!\n",
    "\n",
    "Herring cooked in soy sauce and sugar was a popular protein source back in the 19th century in the region. Eventually, there was a restaurant chef in Kyoto that started serving the herring with soba noodles. Since then, Nishin Soba gained popularity across Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"781\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221359802-7ccc5d4e-5ff2-4975-bdd6-a930825f97ee.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We eat soba noodles with other toppings, such as tempura, duck, and curry, as well. But when you visit Kyoto, make sure you try the Nishin Soba (にしんそば in Japanese). It is typically served warm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Kyoto is far from the coast, historically the city did not have easy access to fresh seafood, so fish was often preserved to make it last longer. One such popular preserved fish is Pacific herring, which is known as nishin. In the 19th century, Pacific herring was cooked in soy sauce and sugar to extend its shelf life. In 1882, Yosakichi, the sous-chef of Matsuba restaurant invented nishin soba, a warm and light noodle soup dish made with nishin and soba (buckwheat noodles). Another place to try this nutritious comfort food is Takehana, a modest little noodle café that also serves a good selection of local beers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obanzai Ryori\n",
    "\n",
    "Obanzai is a bunch of small dishes, almost like a Japanese version of Spanish tapas, using fresh local vegetables in Kyoto. This is traditional home cooking native to the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyoto is famous for fresh vegetables, and there is even a Japanese term, Kyo Yasai (京野菜) for vegetables from Kyoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great news for my vegetarian readers! I know it is very hard to find good vegetarian food in Japan (you still have to be careful though–some restaurants use dashi broth, Japanese fish broth, to cook). Kyoto is definitely the place to go. There are about 32 kinds of vegetables defined as Kyoto Vegetable brand. A lot of them are seasonal, like eggplant in the summer and daikon radish in the winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"688\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221360092-9f00d857-31a0-49cb-9e32-dbc30a00d22c.png\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Obanzai Ryori is the traditional home-style cooking of Kyoto. It is made up of multiple small dishes that are usually quite simple to prepare. Local produce that is in season is best suited for the dishes. Although the cooking methods are usually not complicated, obanzai dishes can be made very rich by chefs skillfully bringing out the natural flavors of the ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key ideas behind the philosophy of obanzai – dishes should be made using only authentic, quality ingredients; they should compliment the mood or constitution of the persons eating it; the chef making the dishes should value the relationships they have with the farmers or market vendors who they procure their ingredients from, and they should use all parts of the ingredient so nothing is wasted. Locally sourced vegetables and dried foods such as bonito (a fish from the same family as tuna) and kombu (umami-flavoured kelp) are commonly used in obanzai. \n",
    "\n",
    "Restaurants that serve obanzai ryori can be found all over Kyoto. Many of them have a relaxed and friendly atmosphere that reflects the home style of cooking. A full meal usually costs 2000 to 3000 yen, but can vary depending on the number and type of dishes ordered. Good places to sample this style of cooking include Nakashimaya, a lively eatery in a renovated townhouse, and Oryori Menami, a family-run establishment that’s been around for more than 70 years.\n"

    "As you know, Japan is a huge sushi land.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let’s talk about sushi in Kyoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically speaking, people in Kyoto did not have access to fresh seafood easily, as it is located far away from the sea. People still ate fish, but it was delivered from either the West or the North, where Fukui prefecture is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you must be wondering “OK, Kyoto is not a good place to eat sushi?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmmm, my answer would be yes and no. There are some great sushi restaurants in the city, and I believe you should at least try Saba sushi (鯖寿司).\n",
    "\n",
    "Saba (mackerel) sushi is another traditional Japanese dish in Kyoto. In the old days, fresh mackerel covered with salt from the North used to get delivered to Kyoto. It was eaten on special occasions locally, and was not a daily meal like Obanzai. Today, chefs marinate the fish in vinegar and press it with rice to make saba sushi, quite different from the regular nigiri sushi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part of saba sushi?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Saba sushi brings a really a nice combination of fattiness from the fish and sourness from vinegar. It is different from the regular sushi you are used to eating. Unique, authentic, and tasty.**\n",

In Kyoto, though, you will see a lot of **Tonkotsu, pork broth ramen.** Tonkotsu is not originally from Kyoto, but as a big college town, Tonkotsu ramen is quite popular for college students as well as locals.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are good ramen restaurants across the city. You can check out my recommendations below. Also, if you are really into ramen and have extra time to explore a more non-touristy part of the city, go to this neighborhood called Ichijoji (一乗寺).\n",

    "### Kaiseki Ryori\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyoto’s sophisticated approach to dining is best exemplified by kaseiki ryori ­– multi-course haute cuisine that’s served in many of the restaurants and inns in the city’s famous former geisha district, Gion. Originating from the thoughtfully crafted celebratory banquets prepared for Japan’s upper class during the Edo period from 1603 to 1868, kaseiki ryori is served degustation-style and pays homage to seasonal ingredients with beautifully plated and delicately portioned dishes handcrafted by skilled chefs and their apprentices. From the counter seats of **Kyoto’s Michelin-star Gion Karyo** you can watch a team of chefs prepare the following kaseiki ryori courses from the open kitchen: sakizuke (appetizer), nimono (a soup or simmered dish), mukozuke (a sashimi dish), hassun (a dish made with seasonal ingredients), yakimono (a grilled dish), hanmono (a rice dish) and, finally, a dessert. For a more homely kaiseki experience, book a seat at **Gion Nanba**, where two chefs working in a compact kitchen serve creative seasonal dishes such as sea eel with winter melon in okra soup in a small, relaxed dining room.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaiseki ryori (会席料理) is traditional Japanese multi-course haute cuisine. Its origins are found many centuries ago in the simple meals served at the tea ceremony, but later it evolved into an elaborate dining style popular among aristocratic circles. Today, kaiseki is served in specialized restaurants or can be enjoyed by staying at a ryokan (Japanese style inn). Kyoto-style kaiseki ryori (kyo kaiseki) is particularly refined, placing an emphasis on subtle flavors and local, seasonal ingredients. A kaiseki meal has a prescribed order of courses which is determined by the cooking method of each dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way for travelers to enjoy kaiseki is staying at a ryokan where a kaiseki dinner is included with the stay. But kaiseki meals can also be enjoyed at restaurants, including high-end ryotei, many of which can be found in the Pontocho and Gion districts. A good kaiseki meal usually costs around 10,000 yen per person, but prices can go as high as 30,000 yen or as low as 6,000 yen. Some restaurants depart from tradition and include elements of foreign cuisines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaiseki meals have a prescribed order to their dishes, most of which are prepared by using one of the common techniques of Japanese cooking. However, kaiseki chefs have considerable freedom to add, omit or substitute courses in order to highlight regional and seasonal delicacies and personal style. Below is a list of courses as they typically appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Starters**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Aperitif (Shokuzen-shu):** The meal may be started off with a small glass of alcohol. Usually it is a sweet wine or local alcohol.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Appetizers:** A selection of beautifully prepared, bite-sized appetizers start the meal. This is often served on a long dish known as a hassun named after its typical length of eight sun (about 24 cm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main courses**: Kaiseki courses are categorized by cooking method, with each dish representing one of the methods. Not all dishes may be present, however, as chefs will often include or omit dishes depending on the season and the chef's individual style.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Soup (Suimono):** The soup is an integral part of a kaiseki meal. It is often a simple clear broth sparingly garnished with vegetables, tofu or seafood.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Sashimi (Otsukuri):** Sashimi is thinly sliced, raw fish, usually served on a bed of shredded daikon (Japanese radish) and accompanied by soya sauce and a small amount of wasabi paste. Sashimi is sometimes served with the starters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Boiled Dish (Nimono):** Nimono is a dish made by boiling, simmering or stewing vegetables and meat or seafood, often in a mixture of soya sauce, sweet cooking sake and sugar.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Grilled Dish (Yakimono):** Yakimono dishes are usually either grilled fish or meat. Grilled fish may be a local fresh water variety or seafood depending on the region. Grilled meat often features local wagyu (prime Japanese beef).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Deep Fried Dish (Agemono):** The fried dish is commonly tempura (seafood and vegetables deep fried in a light flour batter). It is commonly served towards the end of the meal, alongside a light dipping sauce or salt seasoning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Steamed Dish (Mushimono):** The most common steamed dish is chawanmushi, a savory egg custard flavored with fish stock, that contains small morsels of mushrooms, chicken, ginkgo nuts and seafood. It is served in a teacup shaped, lidded dish and eaten with a small spoon.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Vinegared Dish (Sunomono):** Sunomono dishes usually consist of vegetables and seafood (often shrimp or octopus) dressed in a vinegar based sauce. These dishes are usually served in small, shallow bowls to accommodate their vinegar dressings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shokuji**: The shokuji set consists of rice, miso soup and pickles (tsukemono) and is always served toward the end of the meal before dessert.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Rice:** A bowl of white rice is most commonly served, although some ryokan have come up with creative variations such as mugi gohan (rice with barley), okayu (rice porridge), takenoko gohan (rice with bamboo shoots) and other seasonal rice dishes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Miso Soup:** Accompanying the rice is a bowl of miso soup, made by dissolving miso paste in fish stock and adding additional ingredients such as seafood, vegetables and tofu.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Pickles (Tsukemono):** A small assortment of pickled vegetables is the third element of the shokuji. It may include pickles such as takuan (pickled daikon radish), umeboshi (pickled plum) or hakusai no sokusekizuke (pickled Chinese cabbage).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dessert**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Sweets:** A dessert, such as local or seasonal fresh fruit, sorbet or other light dessert makes up the final course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shojin Ryori\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"716\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221353645-7901db99-74aa-4c70-b691-4e2f15a9221f.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas kaiseki developed out of the affluence of the aristocrats, **shojin ryori developed from the austerity of Buddhist monks.** Prohibited from taking the life of other living creatures, Buddhist monks had to make do without meat or fish in their diet. Consisting of strictly vegetarian dishes, shojin ryori can nonetheless be savory and filling. Travelers who spend the night at a temple lodging will be able to enjoy a meal as part of the stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common ingredient in shojin ryori is tofu, which is a local specialty of Kyoto. The preparation of tofu is so common that it can also be referred to as Tofu Ryori (\"tofu cuisine\"). One popular dish that is widely served at tofu restaurants in Kyoto is Yudofu, soft tofu simmered with vegetables in broth. A meal of Yudofu usually costs 1500 to 2000 yen, but the price can be higher or lower depending on the quality of the restaurant. The **Nanzenji and Arashiyama districts** are particularly famous for tofu cuisine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vegetarians will be well looked after in Kyoto because they can get their fill of delicious vegetarian food at Kyoto’s many Buddhist shojin ryori eateries. Buddhism came to Japan in the sixth century by way of India and China and today Kyoto is home to more than 1,600 Buddhist temples. One of the tenets of Buddhism is ahimsa (compassion for all sentient beings), which stipulates that Buddhists should not harm any living thing. This gave rise to shojin ryori – also known as Buddhist devotional cuisine – a type of cuisine that doesn’t include meat or meat products. A shojin ryori meal usually includes foods of five colours – red, green, white, black and yellow, which represent the five elements of Japanese Buddhism – fire, wood, metal, water and earth. Ingredients often include tofu, sesame seeds, and vegetables such as daikon radish and eggplant. Nourish your body and spirit with a shojin ryori meal at Ajiro, which serves items such as pistachio tofu and wheat gluten wrapped in bamboo, or Hale, a humble café in Nishiki Market that does affordable, well balanced and tasty shojin ryori set lunches.\n",

    "### Yudofu (Boiled tofu) & Yuba\n",
    "Kyoto’s pure water enables the production of some of the finest soybean foods, such as yudofu (cubes of creamy boiled tofu) and yuba (soybean sheets).\n",

    "<img width=\"694\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221362402-c21dc04a-3f76-48b1-852b-6bae1adb6426.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps no dish symbolizes Kyoto better than yudofu. It is made with just tofu, water, kelp and a dipping sauce. The kelp is laid on the bottom of a stewpot to which tofu and water are then added and heated. One scoops the tofu out and eats it together with the dipping sauce, which is usually the ponzu soy sauce-based vinaigrette.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yudofu was born in Kyoto out of shojin ryori, which is the vegetarian cuisine originally derived from the dietary restrictions of Buddhist monks. Specialty yudofu restaurants were founded near the Nanzenji temple around 1635 and some are still there today. Tofu is made from soy beans and water. Kyoto, with its high-quality groundwater, has been a popular site of tofu-making for over 150 years. That being the case, Yudofu, tofu warmed in kombu broth and eaten with soy sauce, is one of Kyoto's representational dishes. It's a classic dish in temples, where monks eat vegetables instead of meat, so there are plenty of yudofu restaurants around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes referred to as hatake no niku, meaning ‘meat from the fields’ in Japanese, yuba is derived from the skimmed layer that forms when soybean milk is heated. The technique for making yuba was first invented in China then brought to Japan by Buddhist monks, where it became a popular local food. A good restaurant to sample this high protein, low-calorie, savoury treat is Toyouka Jaya, which does a delicious dish of yuba stew over rice. You can also buy dried yuba as gifts from Senmaruya, a shop that has been making it since 1804.\n",

    "Senmaizuke literally means the “thousand sheet pickle.” Big, round Shogoin turnips are cut into slices just one millimeter thick and pickled together with konbu kelp. Sugukizuke uses a different kind of turnip called sugukina. The production of this small-headed, long-leafed turnip has been strictly controlled for well over a century – confined to an area around Kamigamo Shrine. The fermentation process mellows the vegetable’s natural sourness to a refreshing tartness.\n",

This is because the city’s kyo-tsukemono – or Kyoto pickles – are regarded as some of the best in Japan. Before refrigeration was available, locally grown vegetables spoiled easily in Kyoto’s hot and humid summers, so they were pickled to extend their usability. Established in 1940, **Uchida Tsukemono is a shop in Nishiki Market** that sells some of the best senmaizuke – a quintessential Kyoto radish pickle that’s most commonly eaten in winter. If you desire a pickle feast, head to Akoyachaya for their all-you-can-eat pickle buffet with 20 types of pickles that can be enjoyed with rice or porridge.\n",

    "In the food culture of the Kansai area, people tend to prefer beef to pork - in fact, the word 'meat' typically means beef in this region. Beef cutlet (gyu katsu) is a dish that has become popular in the Kanto region, too. This local gourmet food from Kyoto is perfected by being cooked until medium-rare. Thickly sliced and covered with fine bread crumbs, the cutlets are then fried rapidly in fresh oil. Some restaurants even let you choose your favourite cuts of beef. People typically enjoy this dish with Japanese seasonings or spices, such as soy sauce with wasabi, salt with Japanese pepper (sansho), and grated Japanese radish."

    "\n",
    "As the home of the tea ceremony, Kyoto is a great place to try matcha. Many tea houses within temple grounds, or in tourist areas, can serve you with a bowl of the frothy green tea – with or without the ceremony. Matcha is the highest grade of Japanese green tea. It is made from tea leaves grown under special conditions, followed by similarly careful drying and grinding processes that heighten its color, flavor, aroma and nutritional content. All of this makes drinking matcha a sensual experience.\n",

The mixture is steamed, spread into a thin, half-pipe shape and baked to create crisp, slightly hard cookies that look like small brown roof tiles. This type of yatsuhashi has been around since 1689.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960s, a new, “raw” version, called nama-yatsuhashi was created. For this type, the mixture is not baked. The soft dough is cut into a square and folded triangularly over sweet bean paste. As well as the original cinnamon flavor, there are also matcha and sesame ones, and more modern creations such as chocolate and banana. For those not keen on bean paste – no matter how it’s flavored – you can also buy just the skins.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since green tea was first introduced to Kyoto from China in the early 9th country,  tea became popular across Japan. There is Uji, where some of the most expensive green tea is produced in Kyoto. Even in the city, there are tons of green tea stores and shops serving different kinds of green tea products.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have heard many green tea related words, such as Matcha, Sencha, Ryokucha, etc. Here is a little breakdown for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ryokucha (緑茶):** It is the broadest term that means green tea in Japanese. Both black tea and green tea are produced from the same kind of tea leaves, and Japanese green tea is produced by steaming, not pan firing like Chinese tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sencha (煎茶):** The most common green tea/Ryokucha type across Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gyokuro (玉露):** One of the most expensive green tea/Ryokucha types. The tea leaves are the same kind as Sencha (described above), but Gyokuro is grown under shade prior to plucking bringing a sweeter flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maccha (抹茶):** If you grind the Gyokuro leaves into a fine powder, it becomes Maccha (Matcha). This is what we use during the Japanese tea ceremony with whisks. A type of powdered green tea that is famously grown in the Uji region just outside Kyoto, matcha is used in a variety of desserts and beverages throughout the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe learning about Japanese green tea and experiencing the Japanese tea ceremony is fun and interesting. Also, I want you to try some green tea sweets while you visit Kyoto."

If you ask people from the Kanto region, “What is ikayaki?”, their answer will be, “It’s a single grilled squid with a sweet and spicy sauce”. But if you ask the same question to people from Kansai region, they will probably say something like “it is made by baking squid in a mixture of flour and water in a sandwich style”.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is a bit of a regional disagreement as to what ikayaki should taste and look like, everyone agrees that it is delicious. The dough is chewy and the flavor of squid fills your mouth when you eat it and it is usually eaten with okonomiyaki sauce after it’s baked.\n",

    "Skewered beef tendon, pre-boiled to remove extra fat and simmered with mirin and white miso, **is just as popular as deep-fried skewers (kushikatsu) when it comes to good cheap eats in** **Shinsekai, Osaka**. The name doteyaki – literally meaning 'cooked bank' – is said to come from how the dish is cooked, simmering away while miso paste (placed around the edge of a deep pan to form a bank) is gradually mixed in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, people eat this super-tender and mild beef tendon stew with condiments such as a Japanese mixture of seven spices (shichimi) or chopped green onions. It goes with bevvies such as beer or shochu highball (chuhai). \n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to Osaka soul foods, butaman is on the same level as okonomiyaki and takoyaki. The steamed pork bun has a natural sweetness that comes from the onions used in the pork filling. It's carefully wrapped in dough by hand before steamed in bamboo baskets. You can buy a couple from a vendor and enjoy them while you're exploring the streets – locals particularly enjoy butaman with mustard or Worcestershire sauce.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the typical hand-shaped sushi you'd come across in Japan, Osaka's box sushi is basically made for the purpose of preserving. Hako zushi – also called Osaka sushi – consists of vinegared rice pressed in a wooden frame with seafood marinated in vinegar. This dish is often enjoyed during festive occasions and at theatres, thanks to its beautiful presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can enjoy box sushi without soy sauce since the rice and ingredients are already seasoned. Unlike Edo-style sushi, where the rank of a sushi restaurant was determined by the flavour of the tuna, hakozushi tends to use white fish from the Seto Inland Sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hako-zushi, or box-sushi, is made with vinegared rice and varying ingredients like flavored conger eel, shrimp, small sea bream, and thick egg omelets. It is then pressed into a wooden frame, giving it its alternate name, “oshi-zushi,” pressed sushi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the traditional Edo nigiri sushi made with fresh fish and consumed immediately, hako-zushi retains its delicious flavor even when eaten later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sushi has been a food for guests or during celebrations since the Meiji era, and its bright and colorful appearance is representative of Osaka. You can even buy it at department stores, making it convenient to eat back at your hotel or on excursions and picnics.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Udon suki is a local dish that was invented in the traditional luxurious Japanese restaurants (ryotei) of Osaka during the early part of the Showa era. While its name may sound similar to sukiyaki (stewed beef seasoned with soy sauce and sugar), this dish is in fact totally different. This is a hotpot of udon noodles and various ingredients stewed together in clear stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specialist udon restaurants offer udon suki with a luxurious hotpot containing fine and fresh ingredients such as shrimp and seafood, chicken, and seasonal vegetables. This is a popular wintertime dish for families at home, who sit together around an earthenware pot (donabe) to partake. \n",

    "One of the most beloved foods throughout Japan is udon. Udon is made by kneading wheat flour with water, stretching it thin, cutting it into noodles, and then boiling them. There are two standard types of udon: kitsune and tanuki. Kitsune is an udon noodle in a light broth topped with a large piece of fried tofu. Tanuki is the same type of udon topped with many tempura scraps. For Kitsune Udon, the deep richness comes from the fried tofu and makes your udon flavorful. It is the perfect Osaka udon for the cold season!\n",

Udon in Osaka is softer than Kagawa's firm and chewy Sanuki udon. Enjoy the varieties of udon that the locals love, such as udon with mild deep-fried beancurd simmered in sweet stock (kitsune udon), udon with beef innards fried in lard (kasu udon), and udon in a rich dashi-curry soup. \n",

    "Kintsuba is a Japanese confectionery made in the shape of a sword guard. It originated in the Kansai region during the Edo era, where it was also called gintsuba (Japanese for 'silver sword guard') after its white colour. Covered with rice flour when baked, this delicious confectionery has a filling of sweetened and crushed beans. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it was brought into Edo (modern-day Tokyo), wheat flour dough was used to cover the filings and obtain a golden colour when baked, with the belief that gold brings more luck than silver. While you can buy prepackaged kintsuba at station booths, the best ones come freshly baked at popular local shops. The cakes are soft on the outside and a little chewy, accompanied by a memorably rich taste from the filling. Product demonstrations sometimes take place at certain department stores, so keep on the lookout.\n",

    "From okonomiyaki to takoyaki to yakisoba, in Osaka's food culture of flour-based dishes, red pickled ginger also plays a large role. Red pickled ginger is made from fresh, young ginger marinated in plum vinegar.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of using it as a topping, part of Osaka’s culture is deep-frying it in whole pieces as tempura. Loved by children and adults alike, this sour yet delicious snack can be eaten as-is, paired with alcohol, or topped with sauce and eaten along with rice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find red pickled ginger tempura in the deli section of supermarkets and at tempura shops, so be sure to give it a try.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you like seafood and complete famous Japanese food such as sushi and Kaisendon (seafood bowl), it is recommended to try Tecchiri and Tessa in Dotonbori. Tecchiri and Tessa are cooked with fugu (pufferfish), and the fish is consumed most in Osaka (60% of all in Japan). Tecchiri is served in a Shabushabu style with a hot pot and Tessa in Sashimi style (raw fish). For the authentic taste of the regional dishes, Zuboraya is one of the most-visited fugu restaurants in Dotonbori.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugu or blowfish is a special delicacy, usually eaten raw, which is famous for being poisonous if prepared by unskilled hands. Actually, though, you don’t need to worry about fugu’s reputation for danger. All fugu chefs are specially trained in its preparation for three years before they qualify for a license. These days people only die from eating fugu if they are foolish enough to prepare it at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to serve fugu is as super thin slices of sashimi arranged in a floral pattern on a large plate. Served like this, it has a light and subtle flavor, but you can also eat it as shabu shabu style hotpot, in tempura, in a vegetable stew, or deep fried as fugu kara-age. Dried fins of fugu can also be baked and served in hot sake as hire-zake.\n"

    "1. [Matsuzakagyu Yakiniku M (焼肉 Ｍ 法善寺横丁店) - 100 chf per person](http://bit.ly/2VKDGfi): One of the most recommended ways to enjoy Wagyu beef is with Yakiniku style (Japanese BBQ). Matsuzakagyu Yakiniku M (焼肉 Ｍ 法善寺横丁店) is a Yakiniku restaurant in Osaka that serves **high-quality Matsusaka Wagyu at a reasonable price.** At Matsuzaka Yakiniku M, grilling is the main way to cook Wagyu. There are a number of private rooms available for up to 20 people in the restaurant, so if you are visiting in groups you can smoothly make reservations here. There are also English menu and staffs who can speak both English and Chinese, so you will have no problem ordering dishes even if you understand no Japanese. **Matsuzakagyu Yakiniku M buys whole cow, not by parts, and this makes it possible for them to provide Wagyu dishes in various cuts of meat at very reasonable price for their customers compared to other restaurants in Osaka.** When you eat Matsusaka Wagyu here, I strongly recommend you eat them with soy sauce or salt which they have purchased from all over Japan. And I guarantee that you will become a Wagyu fan after trying pure authentic Matsusaka Wagyu here at Matsuzakagyu Yakiniku M.

    "1. [**Sukiyaki Kitamura - 137CHF per person Michelin 1 star**](http://bit.ly/2UdSce6): The restaurant Kitamura(北村) is located in a busy downtown area, Shinsaibashi, Osaka. Kitamura is a long-established sukiyaki specialty restaurant founded in 1881, and there are no Japanese Wagyu fans who have never heard of the name of Kitamura. Their Kansai style sukiyaki is a bit different from Kanto style Sukiyaki which is mainly popular in Tokyo. They add more sugar in the pot to soften the meat, so the texture of the meat become very smooth and melt in your mouth. The restaurant has very limited number of rooms for private use designed in a Sukiya style, so it’s highly recommended to make a booking week earlier when visiting Kitamura. I hope you enjoy the harmony of the Japanese traditional taste here at Kitamura. Access: 5 mins walk from Shinsaibashi Station (心斎橋駅) Business Hours: 4:00 pm-10:00 pm (Mon-Sat) Closed: Sun Price Range: 15,000 -20,000 yen (dinner) => **NEED RESERVATION**\n",

The restaurant has a long history and has been offering Wagyu shabu-shabu for about 50 years since its establishment in Namba in 1972.

    "1. [**MISONO Osaka - 103 per person**](http://bit.ly/2P7kJB2): If you wish to taste the high quality Kobe Beef in Osaka, this is the place. Misono (みその)  was founded in 1945 as a Teppanyaki style steak restaurant that only serves Kobe Beef. Since the establishment Misono has always put their focus on creating healthy and delicious Wagyu dishes. That means Misono never rely on chemical seasonings so that they can maximize the natural flavor of the ingredients they use. Misono’s passion for Kobe Beef is incomparably strong that they even set the strict standard of their own to rank Beef Wagyu such as; **being a pure Kuroge Wagyu (Japanese black cattle), having passed 24 months or longer after the birth, and having not given a chemical feed or growth hormone. Misono considers these conditions as essential factors for raising Kobe Wagyu cattle.** Chefs at Misono also offers wine, sake, beer and shochu that best fit each of their dishes. Personally, I recommend you to try the sake called Hukujyu(福寿), a 300-year-old, fruity and refreshing sake that is also rooted in Kobe City. Access: 8 mins walk from Osaka Station (大阪駅) Business Hours: 11:30 am-2:00 pm, 5 pm-10 pm (Mon-Sat). Closed: Sun Price Range: 2,000–3,000 (lunch), 10,000 -15,000 yen (dinner)\n",

    "1. [**Gururi**](http://bit.ly/2VKiHt3): The last Wagyu restaurant we introduce is Gururi(ぐるり) which I personally found the most attractive among the Wagyu restaurants in Osaka . I would like to recommend this restaurant Gururi, especially for the tourists who came to Japan for the first time. We understand it is always hard to make a decision when it comes to choosing the best restaurants in Japan since the country is incredibly rich in food culture. But this time, Gururu could be your answer. **The restaurant has both course and a la carte menu with delicious beef dishes. Gururi’s course menu includes a wide variety of creative Japanese Wagyu dishes including Kobe Beef which makes them to be known as Wagyu Izakaya.** There are counter seats and dining tables available.
