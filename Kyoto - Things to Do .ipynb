    "# A few words about Kyoto\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyoto is a must-go city, and it is different from any other city in Japan. The city was Japan’s capital from the 8th century to the 19th century, being the political and cultural hub for a long time. The Japanese emperor lived there during that entire period, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrounded by the hills of central Honshu, Kyoto is one of Japan's largest cities. Although one of Japan's great tourist destinations, it is famous for having preserved much of the atmosphere of the past, having been the only major Japanese city to escape the devastation of WWII.\n",
    "\n",
    "Celebrated as the residence of the Emperor, and Japan's principal cultural center for almost 1,100 years, Kyoto today boasts numerous things to do and great places to visit, including exploring the fine examples of sculptures, paintings, and other art forms in its many museums and galleries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Kyoto travel itinerary should include seeing non-touristy sites, too. These should include the many examples of its centuries-old architecture, much of it influenced by Buddhism, which can still be seen in the splendid temples located in the quieter, less visited corners of the old city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyoto continues to play an important role in Japanese religion, with 30 of the city's temples still serving as centers of various Buddhist sects, along with some 200 Shinto shrines within the city limits. All told, UNESCO World Heritage Site status has been designated to 17 historic buildings in Kyoto."

    "Built in 947, Kitano Tenmangu’s plum blossoms and golden lanterns have become a symbol of Kyoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of Tenmangu shrines in Japan, and they’re all dedicated to Tenjin, the patron deity of academics. During exam season, Japanese students and their parents journey here to pet the cow statue heads and pray for wisdom and high scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kitano Tenmangu has an extraordinary plum blossom garden, with hundreds of trees lining the curved walking paths. From late February to early March, you can pay to stroll around the fairytale gardens and enjoy refreshments at small tables facing the colorful grove.\n",

    "## Kinkaku-ji\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221346402-43ef6f0f-5d36-4c40-a051-785c3c697583.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the UNESCO sites in Kyoto, it’s hard to beat Kinkaku-ji. Known as the Golden Pavilion, this Zen Buddhist temple was originally constructed in 1397 as a wealthy shogun’s retirement villa. The building you see today is actually a partial reconstruction, but that doesn’t make it any less magical!\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinkaku-ji is surrounded by a large pond, making for mesmerizing reflections in the water. There’s also a lovely strolling garden and traditional tea house in the complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ginkaku-ji\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"730\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221346524-443ba851-9f36-4ad9-ae4c-003f6b7325c9.png\">\n",

    "Near Kyoto’s eastern mountains lies Ginkaku-ji, a.k.a. the Silver Pavilion. Despite its nickname, you won’t find a hint of silver on its facade!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ginkaku-ji’s official name is Higashiyama Jisho-ji,and it was intended to be a shiny silver version of Kinkaku-ji. Sadly, the project to cover the facade in silver leaf never happened. To this day, the temple remains a humble–albeit pretty–wooden structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Ginkaku-ji’s fantastic gardens, including one made of raked sand, work in harmony with the simple exterior. The combination of wood and greenery create a calming, zen-like atmosphere.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The northern entrance to the Philosopher’s Path is conveniently located a few minutes’ walk from Ginkaku-ji. This scenic footpath gets its name from Nishida Kitaro, the 20th century Japanese philosopher who (allegedly) walked the route for daily meditation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll find cute cafes, independent shops, and hundreds of cherry blossom trees lining the canal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes about 20 minutes to walk the entire 2km path. To keep this 2 day Kyoto itinerary on schedule, you can take around 45 minutes to shop, take photos, and stroll. Definitely pop into Suzuki Shofudo, an adorable papercraft shop with a frog mascot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Eikan-do Zenrin-ji is easily one of Kyoto’s most beautiful temples, especially during the autumn season. People travel from all over the world to see the vibrant trees surrounding the vast Hojo Pond and stone bridge. If the line isn’t too long, climb the steps of the pagoda for stellar views of the complex.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nestled along the base of Kyoto’s Higashiyama mountains, Nanzen-ji is one of Japan’s most significant Buddhist temples. Thanks to its elevated location, the towering wooden temple gate offers lovely views, and the sprawling grounds and garden are a peaceful escape from the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Founded in the mid-13th century, Nanzen-ji started as a retirement villa for Emperor Kameyama. It was later converted into a Zen temple and expanded. Although the original buildings were destroyed during the 14th-16th century civil wars, the grounds were rebuilt and boast a number 500-year-old structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s free to explore the main grounds of Nanzen-ji (including the famous gate and brick aqueduct), which is all you’ll have time for during this busy 2 day Kyoto itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kiyomizu-dera\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"677\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221347193-cded5780-9610-4879-b936-93d48a1a3476.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With a multi-story wooden hall and enormous observation deck, it’s no wonder Kiyomizu-dera is one of Kyoto’s top tourist attractions. The vast temple complex of buildings and gardens is set on a hill among a forest of bamboo and trees, which turn brilliant hues of red and gold during autumn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiyomizu-dera is known as the “Pure Water Temple” thanks to the crystal clear Otowa waterfall nearby. Other highlights include the 3-story Koyasu Pagoda and the various smaller halls and shrines whose purposes range from matchmaking to safe travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fushimi Inari Shrine\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"687\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102493/221347211-5f261369-c5b7-4d6a-a493-8c7a94252c4d.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a reason I saved Fushimi Inari Taisha for last: it’s one of Kyoto’s most crowded sightseeing spots! Fortunately, arriving in the evening means avoiding most of the tourist groups that clog the path through the seemingly endless 10,000 torii gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vermilion gates line the path up Mount Inari, linking the main Shinto shrine at the base to smaller ones further up the mountain. As you journey up the mountain, you’ll spot plenty of fox statues that represent the god Inari, protector of rice growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes around three hours to walk all the way to the top and back, and it gets tiring quickly. Luckily, there are multiple landing spots where you can easily turn around and descend back to the train station if you can’t carry on due to fatigue or fading daylight.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto-gosho), built in AD 794 and replaced several times after being destroyed by fire, remains one of the city's most visited historic sites. Although the present building was constructed in 1855, it still impresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupying a large (once-walled) enclosure near the heart of the city, highlights include its finely decorated gates and important rooms and buildings. These include the Hall for State Ceremonies (Shishinden), the Emperor's Residence (Seiryo-den), the Courtroom (Ko-gosho), and the Imperial Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the lovely grounds of this Kyoto landmark are open to the public, the palace itself can only be visited as part of a guided tour operated by the Imperial Household Agency. Be sure to plan ahead and check their website for reservations and application forms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sanjūsangen-dō (Rengyoin Temple), or the Temple of the 33 Niches, takes its name from its rather unusual structure: its façade is divided into 33 (sanjusan) niches (gen) to reflect the belief that Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy, could take on 33 different personifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally built in 1164, the present elongated building was constructed in 1266 after a fire destroyed its predecessor. Evidence of its former importance as a place of training in archery can still seen in the many holes in its ancient pillars and timbers made by arrowheads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important of its many works of art is the Kannon with a Thousand Hands, a nearly three-and-a-half-meter-tall statue. Dating from the 13th century, it's famous for the 500 standing figures of Kannon lined up on either side of it. Also of note are the additional sculptures of the 28 \"celestial auxiliaries,\" spirits considered subordinate to Kannon, located behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nishi Honganji Temple ??\n",

    "\n",
    "The chief temple of the original Jodo-shinshu sect, Nishi Honganji Temple is an outstanding example of Buddhist architecture. Highlights include the Hondo, or Main Hall. Rebuilt in 1760, notable features of this fine structure include a number of rooms decorated with paintings on gold backgrounds, and numerous important statues, some dating from the 6th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also of interest is the Founder's Hall (Daishi-do). Here, you'll find the much-revered statue of Shinran, carved in 1244 and later covered with a coat of lacquer mingled with his ashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable building is the Daishoin, or Treasury, with various rooms named after the exquisite wall and ceiling paintings with which they're decorated. These include the Sparrow Room (Suzume-no-ma), the Room of the Wild Geese (Gan-no-ma), and the Chrysanthemum Room (Kiku-no-ma) with its fine 17th-century paintings of flowers in gold and white by Kaiho Yusetsu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also of interest is the Higashi-Honganji Temple of the Jodo-shinshu sect. Founded in 1602, it's home to a number of examples of fine artwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a few parts of these temples are open to the public, so be sure to make arrangements through the temple's website in advance of your visit to include other areas not normally accessible.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Daitoku-ji Temple - the Zen Temple of Great Virtue - is one of the principal temples of the Rinzai sect and was founded in 1324. The present structures date from the 16th and 17th centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 22 buildings on-site, seven are open to the public. These include the Kara-mon, a Chinese-style gate with magnificent carvings, and the two-story main gate, Sammon, built in 1589 and notable for its many fine ceiling paintings and statues. The Main Hall, the Butsuden (or Daiyu-den), was built in 1664 and contains a statue of Shakyamuni with his disciples Anna and Kayo and a figure of Daito-kokushi, first Abbot of the temple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the Main Hall is the Lecture Hall, or Hatto, based on Chinese models, and the Hojo, or Abbot's Lodging, with its paintings, wooden tablet, and adjoining garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other highlights include the old Abbot's Lodging (Shinju-an) with its statues and tombs dating from the 14th century, and a lovely Zen garden.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Byōdō-in Temple, established in AD 988, boasts many unique buildings, shrines, and artworks and is worthy of a visit. Highlights include the Phoenix Hall (Hoo-do), with its bronze phoenixes on its two gables and rich interior décor. This attractive hall also features 11th-century paintings, including an imposing gilded figure of Amida, and an altar and ceiling inlaid with bronze and mother-of-pearl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjoining is the Kannon-do, a hall directly above the river and known as the Tsuridono, or Fishing Hall. Be sure to spend time visiting the temple gardens with their many fine ponds, as well as the Byōdō-in Museum with its treasures relating to the temple site, including its 52 wooden Buddha statues, carved phoenixes, and the original temple bell.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s more to Arashiyama district than the iconic bamboo grove! Adjacent to the forest lies **Tenryuji Temple**, a renowned complex of ancient buildings with an elegant Japanese garden. It’s a gorgeous place year-round, but it’s even more impressive when decked out in fall foliage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your visit falls on a weekend, you can pay to enter the Hatto hall and see the famous Cloud Dragon painting.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Tenryuji, head south towards the Katsura River and cross the **Togetsu-kyō Bridge**. Keep an eye out for the traditional wooden boats that ferry sightseers along the scenic riverbank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a few minutes’ walk from the river, you’ll find  the entrance to **Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama**. This mountainside area is home to hundreds of Japanese macaques, and the overlook point at the top has incredible panoramic views over Kyoto. You’ll need around 30 minutes to reach the overlook, so plan accordingly.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of a geisha or maiko (apprentice) on their way to an appointment during your Kyoto 2 day itinerary (but please appreciate them from a distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by walking up **Hanamikoji, Gion’s main street**. Each side is lined with hundreds of shops and street food counters operating under the iconic sakura lanterns. The numerous souvenir shops are perfect for picking up traditional wagashi–Japanese sweets–to bring back home (Kagizen Yoshifusa is my favorite wagashi shop).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Hanamikoji stands **Yasaka Shrine**, one of the most culturally significant shrines in Japan. Every July, the Gion Matsuri festival begins here, with an ornate deity float (mikoshi) parading through the gate and around the city. They illuminate the shrine’s front gate at night, and it glows beautifully at the heart of Gion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meander south towards **Kodai-ji Temple**, where you can explore the lit up grounds and mini bamboo forest. They also run a three minute light and sound show after dark in the sand garden area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right outside of Kodai-ji you’ll find **Ishibe-koji alley**, **one of the prettiest historic streets in Gion.** And for more picturesque paths, continue south to reach **Ninenzaka and Sanenzaka**. These lantern-lit streets offer amazing views of **Kiyomizu’s pagoda** in the distance.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Famous as an entertainment and geisha district, Gion is an area of Kyoto that is well suited to explore on foot. Located on the eastern bank of the Kamogawa River, Gion is an eclectic mix of modern architecture and historical beauty that provides a unique taste of numerous Japanese traditions, from the elaborately dressed geishas to well-preserved 17th-century restaurants and teahouses offering a glimpse of old Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centered on an area encompassing Hanami-Koji Street, Shijo-dori Street, and the waterside promenades of Shirakawa Minami-dori Street, Gion is also famous for its many fine temples. The best-known of these are the 15th-century Silver Pavilion (Ginkakuji) and the Chion-in Temple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chion-in is one of Japan's most famous temples, notable for its 24-meter-high, two-story tower (Sammon-san), which houses the country's largest bell. Weighing 71 tons, it was cast in 1633, and is rung only during festivals in mid-April. Gion is a wonderful (and safe) place to enjoy a walking tour at night, too.\n",
